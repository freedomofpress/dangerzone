#                       REUSING CONTAINER IMAGES:
#                          Anatomy of a hack
#                       ========================
#
# The rest of the Dockerfile aims to do one thing: allow the final container
# image to actually contain two container images; one for the outer container
# (spawned by Podman/Docker Desktop), and one for the inner container (spawned
# by gVisor).
#
# This has already been done in the past, and we explain why and how in the
# design document for gVisor integration (should be in
# `docs/developer/gvisor.md`). In this iteration, we want to also
# achieve the following:
#
# 1. Have a small final image, by sharing some system paths between the inner
#    and outer container image using symlinks.
# 2. Allow our security scanning tool to see the contents of the inner
#    container image.
# 3. Make the outer container image operational, in the sense that you can use
#    `apt` commands and perform a conversion with Dangerzone, outside the
#    gVisor sandbox. This is helpful for debugging purposes.
#
# Below we'll explain how our design choices are informed by the above
# sub-goals.
#
# First, to achieve a small container image, we basically need to copy `/etc`,
# `/usr` and `/opt` from the original Dangerzone image to the **inner**
# container image (under `/home/dangerzone/dangerzone-image/rootfs/`)
#
# That's all we need. The rest of the files play no role, and we can actually
# mask them in gVisor's OCI config.
#
# Second, in order to let our security scanner find the installed packages,
# we need to copy the following dirs to the root of the **outer** container
# image:
# * `/etc`, so that the security scanner can detect the image type and its
#   sources
# * `/var`, so that the security scanner can have access to the APT database.
#
# IMPORTANT: We don't symlink the `/etc` of the **outer** container image to
# the **inner** one, in order to avoid leaking files like
# `/etc/{hostname,hosts,resolv.conf}` that Podman/Docker mounts when running
# the **outer** container image.
#
# Third, in order to have an operational Debian image, we are _mostly_ covered
# by the dirs we have copied. There's a _rare_ case where during debugging, we
# may want to install a system package that has components in `/etc` and
# `/var`, which will not be available in the **inner** container image. In that
# case, the developer can do the necessary symlinks in the live container.
#
#                           FILESYSTEM HIERARCHY
#                           ====================
#
# The above plan leads to the following filesystem hierarchy:
#
# Outer container image:
#
#     # ls -l /
#     lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   root       7 Jan 27 10:46 bin -> usr/bin
#     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root   root    7764 Jan 24 08:14 entrypoint.py
#     drwxr-xr-x   1 root   root    4096 Jan 27 10:47 etc
#     drwxr-xr-x   1 root   root    4096 Jan 27 10:46 home
#     lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   root       7 Jan 27 10:46 lib -> usr/lib
#     lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   root       9 Jan 27 10:46 lib64 -> usr/lib64
#     drwxr-xr-x   2 root   root    4096 Jan 27 10:46 root
#     drwxr-xr-x   1 root   root    4096 Jan 27 10:47 run
#     lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   root       8 Jan 27 10:46 sbin -> usr/sbin
#     drwxrwxrwx   2 root   root    4096 Jan 27 10:46 tmp
#     lrwxrwxrwx   1 root   root      44 Jan 27 10:46 usr -> /home/dangerzone/dangerzone-image/rootfs/usr
#     drwxr-xr-x  11 root   root    4096 Jan 27 10:47 var
#
# Inner container image:
#
#     # ls -l /home/dangerzone/dangerzone-image/rootfs/
#     total 12
#     lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    7 Jan 27 10:47 bin -> usr/bin
#     drwxr-xr-x 43 root root 4096 Jan 27 10:46 etc
#     lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    7 Jan 27 10:47 lib -> usr/lib
#     lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    9 Jan 27 10:47 lib64 -> usr/lib64
#     drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4096 Jan 27 10:47 opt
#     drwxr-xr-x 12 root root 4096 Jan 27 10:47 usr
#
#                           SYMLINKING /USR
#                           ===============
#
# It's surprisingly difficult (maybe even borderline impossible), to symlink
# `/usr` to a different path during image build. The problem is that /usr
# is very sensitive, and you can't manipulate it in a live system. That is, I
# haven't found a way to do the following, or something equivalent:
#
#    rm -r /usr && ln -s /home/dangerzone/dangerzone-image/rootfs/usr/ /usr
#
# The `ln` binary, even if you specify it by its full path, cannot run
# (probably because `ld-linux.so` can't be found). For this reason, we have
# to create the symlinks beforehand, in a previous build stage. Then, in an
# empty container image (scratch images), we can copy these symlinks and the
# /usr, and stitch everything together.
