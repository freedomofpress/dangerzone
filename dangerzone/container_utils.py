    On Linux platforms, this method is basically a no-op since there's no VM

    because it knows how to pass this file to the VM.

    If the container runtime is Podman on Windows/macOS, then we need to copy the
    file to a place where it will be mounted in the Podman machine. Typically, the
    user directory is mounted in the VM [1], so we opt to copy the seccomp profile to
    the cache dir for Dangerzone, which is within the user directory.
