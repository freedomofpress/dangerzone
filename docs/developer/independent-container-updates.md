# Independent Container Updates

Since version 0.9.0, Dangerzone is able to ship container images independently
from issuing a new release of the software.

This is useful as images need to be kept updated with the latest security fixes.

## Nightly images and attestations

Each night, new images are built and pushed to our container registry, alongside
with a provenance attestation, enabling anybody to ensure that the image has
been originally built by Github CI runners, from a defined source repository (in our case `freedomofpress/dangerzone`).

To verify the attestations against our expectations, use the following command:
```bash
poetry run ./dev_scripts/registry.py attest ghcr.io/freedomofpress/dangerzone/dangerzone:latest --repo freedomofpress/dangerzone
```

In case of sucess, it will report back:

```
ðŸŽ‰ The image available at `ghcr.io/freedomofpress/dangerzone/dangerzone:latest` has been built by Github runners from the `freedomofpress/dangerzone` repository.
```
