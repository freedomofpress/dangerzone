# Reproducible builds

We want to improve the transparency and auditability of our build artifacts, and
a way to achieve this is via reproducible builds. For a broader understanding of
what reproducible builds entail, check out https://reproducible-builds.org/.

Our build artifacts consist of:
* Container images (`amd64` and `arm64` architectures)
* macOS installers (for Intel and Apple Silicon CPUs)
* Windows installer
* Fedora packages (for regular Fedora distros and Qubes)
* Debian packages (for Debian and Ubuntu)

As of writing this, only the following artifacts are reproducible:
* Container images (see [#1047](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1047))

In the following sections, we'll mention some specifics about enforcing
reproducibility for each artifact type.

## Container image

### Updating the image

The fact that our image is reproducible also means that it's frozen in time.
This means that rebuilding the image without updating our Dockerfile will
**not** receive security updates.

Here are the necessary variables that make up our image in the `Dockerfile.env`
file:
* `DEBIAN_IMAGE_DIGEST`: The index digest for the Debian container image
* `DEBIAN_ARCHIVE_DATE`: The Debian snapshot repo that we want to use
* `GVISOR_ARCHIVE_DATE`: The gVisor APT repo that we want to use
* `H2ORESTART_CHECKSUM`: The SHA-256 checksum of the H2ORestart plugin
* `H2ORESTART_VERSION`: The version of the H2ORestart plugin

If you update these values in `Dockerfile.env`, you must also create a new
Dockerfile with:

```
make Dockerfile
```

Updating `Dockerfile` without bumping `Dockerfile.in` is detected and should
trigger a CI error.

### Reproducing the image

For a simple way to reproduce a Dangerzone container image, you can checkout the
commit this image was built from (you can find it from the image tag in its
`g<commit>` portion), retrieve the date it was built (also included in the image
tag), and run the following command in any environment:

```
./dev_scripts/reproduce-image.py \
    --debian-archive-date <date> \
    <digest>
```

where:
* `<date>` should be given in YYYYMMDD format, e.g, 20250226
* `<digest>` is the SHA-256 hash of the image for the **current platform**, with
  or without the `sha256:` prefix.

This command will build a container image from the current Git commit and the
provided date for the Debian archives. Then, it will compare the digest of the
manifest against the provided one. This is a simple way to ensure that the
created image is bit-for-bit reproducible.

#### Reproducing the image without having a tag

If you don't have the tag of this image, and only have its digest, then it's not
straightforward to retrieve the Debian archive date and Git commit. We have
built our images though so that it's possible to find this information, with
some external tooling (`crane` and `cosign`).

Getting the Debian archive date:

```
DIGEST=<digest>
LAYER=$(crane manifest ghcr.io/freedomofpress/dangerzone/v1@${DIGEST?} \
  | jq -r '.manifests[0].digest')
crane manifest ghcr.io/freedomofpress/dangerzone/v1@${LAYER?} \
  | jq -r '.annotations."rocks.dangerzone.debian_archive_date"'
```

This should return a date like `20251008`.

Getting the Git commit that the image was built from:

```
DIGEST=<digest>
cosign download attestation ghcr.io/freedomofpress/dangerzone/v1@${DIGEST?} \
  | jq -r '.payload' | base64 -d | jq -r '.predicate.invocation.configSource.digest.sha1'
```

This should return one or more Git commits, that at a certain date have produced
this container image. Pick any of them that you can `git switch` to.

> [!NOTE]
> It may be normal for a commit to not exist anymore, if the image was somehow
> created from a feature branch. Still, one of those commits should be part of
> the `main` branch.
